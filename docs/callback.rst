Rich Callbacks
=====================

**⚠ This article is a stub ⚠**

Previously, Callbacks could not take any arguments in formation-studio. With this being implemented, formation-studio can take limited arguments.

As of right now, callbacks can be used with Events and ``command`` fields.

Format
=======
**Format**: ``{func_name} {arg1} {arg2} kw1=1, kw2=2``
